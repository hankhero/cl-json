# CL-JSON

CL-JSON provides an encoder of Lisp objects to JSON format and a
corresponding decoder of JSON data to Lisp objects. Both the encoder
and the decoder are highly customizable; at the same time, the default
settings ensure a very simple mode of operation, similar to that
provided by YASON or ST-JSON. CL-JSON is well tested and the automated
testcases includes the JSON_checker tests.
